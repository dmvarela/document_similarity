COURSE NAME: Introduction to Microeconomics
COURSE CODE: ECON1110


COURSE DESCRIPTION
Microeconomics examines how individuals, firms, and societies use their scarce resources to attain economic goals, and how different economic systems try to solve this central problem of scarcity. Students will learn how individuals make consumption decisions and how firms determine how much to produce and what price to charge for products/services given their costs and the market structure of the industry they operate within. The topics of public sector economics, labour market fundamentals, environmental economics, and income inequality are also examined.

• Explain common types of behavior exhibited by firms in each market structure
• Identify and explain social costs of various market structures5Critique the economic function of government in Canada and its' role in managing the business environment
